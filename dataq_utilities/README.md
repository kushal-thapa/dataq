# DataQ Utilities Package
This is a Python package for DataQ DI-1100 devices (and maybe others).

I'm not sure the files follow the correct Python structure for a package, but the functions import successfully using the scripts in the "Test Scripts" folder.

Files in the "Documentation" folder are from the DataQ site (https://www.dataq.com/products/di-1100).  They describe the serial protocol and device operation.  The spreadsheet is derived (by me) from the DataQ documents, and simplifies some of the serial protocol conditions.
